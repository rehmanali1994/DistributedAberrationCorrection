Distributed Aberration Correction Techniques Based on Tomographic Sound Speed Estimates

Phase aberration correction is the process of applying delay/phase correction to ultrasound signals after applying focusing delays (based on an assumed speed of sound: usually 1540 m/s) to ultrasound channel data prior to summation in a delay-and-sum (DAS) beamformer. Although phase aberration correction is typically caused by sound speed heterogeneities in the medium, the aberration delays/phases are typically modeled independently for each imaging point without reference to the spatial distribution of sound speed in the medium. Here, we show (1) a tomographic sound speed estimator based on phase aberrations after focusing and (2) two different distributed aberration correction techniques that use a tomographic sound speed estimate to create optimally-focused ultrasound images.
